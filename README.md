# MovieTube
This app is created for showing list of categories that have list of movies that streamed from the server (Node js backend) to this UWP client app and you can rating, like/dislike, make comment and seeing the movie details (story author - director - actors ...)  like YouTube app ðŸ˜…   
Also it has the 3 security fundmentals:
1. Encryption/Decryption data that sended/received between server and client using AES-128-cbc alghorithm
2. Verify the requests that are from signed account not from any user and I achieved this using JWT tech
3. to verify the token is sended from the right server, I decode token to have "sercret keyword" and check this sercret keyword if it's equal to the stored secret keyword in my UWP application or not
